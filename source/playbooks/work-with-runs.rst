What’s a run?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To access runs, select the product menu in the top-left corner of Mattermost, then select **Playbooks**. In the runs list, you can select a run to view more details, such as the overview and retrospective. This is an easy way to assess all the active runs to which you have access.

View run details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you’re in a channel with an active run, select the **Toggle Run Details** icon in the channel header to open the right-hand pane to view the run details. Information such as run name and description can be edited in-line, and the checklists can be collapsed and filtered based on their status.

Some run actions can be edited while the run is in progress. This increases visibility into the run's progress and can improve accountability.
