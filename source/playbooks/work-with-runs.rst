A run is the execution of a playbook. You can start each run in a new channel or you can elect to use the same channel for multiple runs.

To access runs, select the product menu in the top-left corner of Mattermost, then select **Playbooks**. In the runs list, you can select a run to view more details, such as the overview and retrospective. This is an easy way to assess all the active runs to which you have access.

Follow and participate
----------------------

You don't have to be in a run's channel to follow the run. You can:

**Follow**: If you're following a playbook, you won't necessarily be added to each of the playbook's runs but you will be added as a follower. To join a run channel, select **Participate** in the header of that run.
**Participate**: If you're participating in a run it's likely because you're in a team or group of people who've been added to it. In this case, you'll be able to follow the run in the run channel and also view the details in the list of runs in the playbooks tab.

View run details
----------------

When youâ€™re in a channel with an active run, select the **Toggle Run Details** icon in the channel header to open the right-hand pane to view the run details. Information such as run name and description can be edited in-line, and the checklists can be collapsed and filtered based on their status.

Some run actions can be edited while the run is in progress. This increases visibility into the run's progress and can improve accountability.

-------------------------

1. In your run, select **Toggle Run Details** to open the right-hand sidebar.
2. Select **Run details**.
3. Next to the **In Progress** indicator, select **Run Actions**.
4. You can delete the current channel or add additional ones. To find channels, start typing the channel name and select it from the list.
